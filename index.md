#### Synopsis

This course consists of data-centric laboratory experiments that draw on a variety of tools used by professional astronomers. Students will learn to procure and clean data (drawn from a variety of world-class astronomical facilities), assess the fidelity/quality of data, build and apply models to describe data, learn statistical and computational techniques to analyze data (e.g., Bayesian inference, machine learning, parallel computing), and effectively communicate data and associated scientific results.  This class will make use of data from facilities such as Gaia, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the Hubble Space Telescope to explore the structure and composition of the Milky Way, stars, and galaxies throughout the local and distant Universe. There is a heavy emphasis software development in the Python language, statistical techniques, and high-quality communication (e.g., written reports, oral presentations, and data visualization).

<i>This course satisfies the <b>Data Science major requirement</b> for "Computational & Inferential Depth". Read more about the <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/data-science-ba/upper-division">upper division classes for the Data Science BA</a>. This course also satisfies the <a href="https://astro.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-program/astrophysics-major">Laboratory requirement for the <b>Astronomy Major</b></a>.</i>

#### Instructors

* Daniel Weisz (dan.weisz@berkeley.edu; 311 Campbell Hall)
* Joshua Bloom (joshbloom@berkeley.edu; 203 Campbell Hall)
* Kareem El-Badry (GSI, kelbadry@berkeley.edu)




#### Course Aims

* Introduce and motivate a range of analysis techniques and data pipelining
* Gain practical, in-depth experience doing inference on real, open-ended modern astronomical challenges
* Build reproducible, well-tested, well-documented software & infrastructure
* Learn to work with open data and code, and in an open science environment
* Hone presentation (speaking & visualization) skills
* Develop skills for future in academia, industry, ...


#### Course Format

* 4 credits (grad and undergrad)
* 1 weekly 3 hour meeting
* “Show & tell” progress reports + instructor lecture
* 4.5 labs
* Will require a fair amount of dedicated coding time
* It WILL fulfill the astro major lab requirement in Spring 2020
* Ugrad/Grad together/Grads will do a more in-depth labs 


#### Lectures

Mondays 4-7pm in 131 Campbell Hall 


#### Office Hours

* Kareem: TBD in 419 Campbell
* Dan: TBD in 355 Campbell
* Josh: TBD in 203 Campbell


#### Prereqs

* There are no formal prereqs for this class but there are a number of informal requirements, [outlined in this document](https://ucb-datalab.github.io/pages/prereq.html), which you must satisfy.
