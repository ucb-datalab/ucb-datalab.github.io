#### Synopsis

This course consists of data-centric laboratory experiments that draw on a variety of tools used by professional astronomers. Students will learn to procure and clean data (drawn from a variety of world-class astronomical facilities), assess the fidelity/quality of data, build and apply models to describe data, learn statistical and computational techniques to analyze data (e.g., Bayesian inference, machine learning, parallel computing), and effectively communicate data and associated scientific results.  This class will make use of data from facilities such as Gaia, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the Hubble Space Telescope to explore the structure and composition of the Milky Way, stars, and galaxies throughout the local and distant Universe. There is a heavy emphasis software development in the Python language, statistical techniques, and high-quality communication (e.g., written reports, oral presentations, and data visualization).


#### Instructors

* Daniel Weisz (dan.weisz@berkeley.edu; 311 Campbell Hall)
* Joshua Bloom (joshbloom@berkeley.edu; 203 Campbell Hall)
* Kareem El-Badry (GSI, kelbadry@berkeley.edu)


#### Course Aims

* Introduce and motivate a range of analysis techniques and data pipelining
* Gain practical, in-depth experience doing inference on real, open-ended modern astronomical challenges
* Build reproducible, well-tested, well-documented software & infrastructure
* Learn to work with open data and code, and in an open science environment
* Hone presentation (speaking & visualization) skills
* Develop skills for future in academia, industry, ...


#### Course Format

* 4 credits (grad and undergrad)
* 1 weekly 3 hour meeting
* “Show & tell” progress reports + instructor lecture
* 3 or 4 labs + final project & presentation
* Will require a fair amount of dedicated coding time
* It WILL fulfill the astro major lab requreiment in Spring 2019
* Ugrad/Grad together/Grads will do a more in-depth labs 


#### Lectures

Mondays 4-7pm in 131 Campbell Hall (no class on 1/21, 2/18, 3/25)


#### Office Hours

* Kareem: Tu 5-6pm and Fri 9-10am in 419 Campbell
* Dan: Weds 4-5pm in 311 Campbell
* Josh: Thurs 2:30-3:30 in 203 Campbell


#### Prereqs

* Astrophysical background: Astro 7A & 7B OR two of Astro 160, 161, 162.  One course may be taken concurrently.
* Math background: Calculus (including Math 53), Linear Algebra (Math 54 or Physics 89)
* Proficiency or fluency in the Python programming language.
* N.B.: This is NOT the place to learn how to program for the first time
