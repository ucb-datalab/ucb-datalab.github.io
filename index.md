#### Synopsis

This course consists of data-centric laboratory experiments that draw on a variety of tools used by professional astronomers. Students will learn to procure and clean data (drawn from a variety of world-class astronomical facilities), assess the fidelity/quality of data, build and apply models to describe data, learn statistical and computational techniques to analyze data (e.g., Bayesian inference, machine learning, parallel computing), and effectively communicate data and associated scientific results.  This class will make use of data from facilities such as Gaia, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the Hubble Space Telescope to explore the structure and composition of the Milky Way, stars, and galaxies throughout the local and distant Universe. There is a heavy emphasis software development in the Python language, statistical techniques, and high-quality communication (e.g., written reports, oral presentations, and data visualization).

<i>This course satisfies the <b>Data Science major requirement</b> for "Computational & Inferential Depth". Read more about the <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/data-science-ba/upper-division">upper division classes for the Data Science BA</a>. This course also satisfies the <a href="https://astro.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-program/astrophysics-major">Laboratory requirement for the <b>Astronomy Major</b></a>.</i>

#### Instructors

* Daniel Weisz (dan.weisz@berkeley.edu; 311 Campbell Hall)
* Joshua Bloom (joshbloom@berkeley.edu; 203 Campbell Hall)
* Kareem El-Badry (GSI, kelbadry@berkeley.edu)




#### Course Aims

* Introduce and motivate a range of analysis techniques and data pipelining
* Gain practical, in-depth experience doing inference on real, open-ended modern astronomical challenges
* Build reproducible, well-tested, well-documented software & infrastructure
* Learn to work with open data and code, and in an open science environment
* Hone presentation (speaking & visualization) skills
* Develop skills for future in academia, industry, ...


#### Course Format

* 4 credits (grad and undergrad)
* 1 weekly 3 hour meeting
* “Show & tell” progress reports + instructor lecture
* 4.5 labs
* Will require a fair amount of dedicated coding time
* It WILL fulfill the astro major lab requirement in Spring 2020
* Ugrad/Grad together/Grads will do a more in-depth labs 

#### Lab Schedule:
 * Lab 0 (Clusters) — Assigned: Monday 1/20, Due: Friday 2/7 (4pm)
 * Lab 1 (Variable Stars & Dust) — Assigned: Monday 2/3, Due: Tuesday 3/3 (4pm)
 * Lab 2 (Stellar Rotation) — Assigned: Monday 3/2, Due Tuesday 3/17 (4pm)
 * Lab 3 (Stellar Spectra) — Assigned: Monday 3/16, Due Tuesday 4/14 (4pm)
 * Lab 4 (Hubble's Constant) — Assigned: Monday 4/13, Due Tuesday 4/28 (4pm)

#### Lectures

Mondays 4-7pm in 131 Campbell Hall 


#### Office Hours

* Kareem: Thurs 2–3 in 419 Campbell
* Dan: Tue Noon–1pm in 355 Campbell
* Josh: Wed 4–5pm in 203 Campbell

#### Grading

 * 10%: Class Participation – Active engagement in class discussion and lecture, participation during "show and tell"
 * 90%: Lab Reports/Notebooks – due before specified class, -10% for each day late, you can collaborate with people in the class, but all work, writeups, notebooks, coding, plots, etc. MUST be your own. Checkpoints worth 10% of grade for each lab. We'll drop your 2 lowest checkpoint scores.



#### Prereqs

* There are no formal prereqs for this class but there are a number of informal requirements, [outlined in this document](https://ucb-datalab.github.io/pages/prereq.html), which you must satisfy.
