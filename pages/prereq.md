There are no formal prereqs for this class that will be enforced at the time of registration. However, based on our previous experience with this course there are number of components of your past course work which are strongly recommended for you to get the most out of this course:


 - Astrophysical background: Astro 7A & 7B OR two of Astro 160, 161, 162. One course may be taken concurrently.
 - Math background: Calculus (including Math 53), Linear Algebra (Math 54 or Physics 89)
 - Proficiency or fluency in the Python programming language.
    
    
N.B.: This is NOT the place to learn how to program for the first time
