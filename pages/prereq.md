title: Prereqs
---

There are no formal prereqs for this class that will be enforced at the time of registration. However, based on our previous experience with this course there are number of components of your past course work which are strongly recommended for you to get the most out of this course:


 - Astrophysical background: Astro 7A & 7B OR two of Astro 160, 161, 162. One course may be taken concurrently.
 - Math background: Calculus (including Math 53), Linear Algebra (Math 54 or Physics 89)
 - Proficiency or fluency in the Python programming language.
    

We enourage students with a variety of backgrounds to consider taking this class.  You may realize within the first few weeks of class that it is not for you, and that's OK.

N.B.: This is NOT the place to learn how to program for the first time

For those without a strong astrophysics background: it is possible to take and succeed in this class, but it is a lot more challenging as you will have to learn astrophysics as you go.  We will provide some guidance, but much of it will be self-taught.  We recommend that you acquire a copy [Carroll & Ostlie](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Astrophysics-Bradley-Carroll-dp-1108422160/dp/1108422160/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=) or [Ryden & Peterson](https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Astrophysics-Barbara-S-Ryden/dp/0321595580) to help with the astrophysics.


If you have any questions, feel free to reach out by email to the instructors.
