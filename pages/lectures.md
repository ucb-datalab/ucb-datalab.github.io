All lecture material can be found on the course's <a href="https://github.com/ucb-datalab/course-materials_2020.git">GitHub course materials site</a>. You should clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/ucb-datalab/course-materials_2020.git
```

As the materials are changing throughout the semester (and sometimes in real time!) please keep your version up to date by doing a

```
git pull
