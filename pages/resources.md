Resources will be posted here throughout the semester. Diving into this (edifying) material should be of keen interest to those taking the class, but do not consider these formal reading assignments.

### Blogs/Online Material of Interest

-  ["Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation"](http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html) (P. Norvig). Enumerates many of the pitfalls in hypothesis testing, on correlation vs causation, reproducibility, and bias. Good reference set of statistics book at the end of the blog.

### Books

- ["The Visual Display of Quantitative Information"](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) (E. Tufte). Called *"The century's best book on statistical graphics"* this the go-to reference for understanding the core principles of information display.
